# oce budget distribution process

oce budget distribution is a way we are proposing to fund the open 
cooperative ecosystem development. It aims to include different ways
to work: part time, full time or targeted work.
Budget is managed horizontally during monthly open assembly.

This git repo was created to hold the various documentation
we have of the process.

The budged distribution process was originally outlined in [grants.md](./grants.md),
see [links to relavant oce threads](./links.md) of announcements,
discussions, decision threads, and proposals (funded or not)

[template.md](./template.md) is a reminder of the information
that needs to go in each monthly decision thread. It's source
can be copied into a new thread to start the discussion for
that month.

[roles.md](./roles.md) is a description of the various roles
in the grants process. If you are reading this, you are already
playing a role!

This process will likely evolve and changes can be made by creating
pull requests to this repo and having discussions on 
[telegram group](https://t.me/joinchat/Bdq2d0yDFbjRbE2VPKqgrA).
