# Open Cooperative Ecosystem budget distribution

## Background

Since OCE starts, we adopted the Faircoop (Open Coop Work) budget distribution protocol to sustain ourselves.
Basically it considers all people contributions in hours, as hour is the unit of measure adopted by the ecosystem to distribute income among partecipants, based on a rate agreed on the general assembly.
Meanwhile this protocol can work well for basic coordination, it starts to become harder to organize looser, etherogenous and interconnected works based solely on the amount of hours a person logs.
People feel easily discouraged to log their activities based on a hourly rate, a protocol more keen to an exploitation system, than a cooperative one. On the project management side, the whole workflow suffer from not being able to define activities in other ways rather than hours.
The following proposal is a slighlty different way to organize our ecosystem activities flows, from budget approval to budget distribution.

What we want:

- income resilience for each member
- growth of the ecosystem
- happy healthy community
- learning
- simplicity (in the process)
- excitment + celebration


What we don't want:

- people burning out
- too much paperwork
- competition
- centralization of power

The most valuable thing we have is _the community_. Half the reason for oce budget distribution is to give everyone
a fair opportunity to get paid to work on OCE.

## The OCE protocol
The budget distribution lifespan is trimestrial and can be split in the following monthly steps: **Discussion**, **agreement**, **distribution**, **activities**, **validation**.

The agents involved are: 

- OCE Working groups
- User base / backers /funders

## Working groups
They are loosely group of people that converges together to work on specific proposals. A working group can have the lifespan of a grant, or it can continue working together endlessy.
We encourage to make little working group, up to 4 people, to encourage the development of coincise and focused works and at the same time to increase the chance to receive a sufficient income for each partecipant.
It is up to each working group to present with the proposal the needed budget and to organize among members how to split it.
Based on the proposal, a working group can be also made by a single person.

> **FAQ** 
> 
> Why trimestrial? : 
> To give enough mental and economic stability to work on OCE while receiving a monthly income and to maximize the possibility to end up with a valuable production-ready work.
>
> who can apply?: Everyone! Assemblies are open and grants are assigned by consensus.

## Grants process 

### 1. Prepare a proposal
It's a good idea to explore an idea and get feedback before posting a proposal.

**Proposal requirments**: 
- What are you going to do? (does it relate to what we want more of?)
- How are you going to spread your 3 months of work? 
- why are you motivated to do this?

### 2. Approving a proposal
We'll make the first week of each trimestral when we approve the next grants.
We will discuss the proposals for the given months in our assembly and decide which we're going to fund. The community may suggest changes to a proposal. A grant that is not included in a trimestral might be in the next. If a grant is turned down, you can still make another grant.

We'll only make a few grants at a time, so that we can learn how it goes and improve the process later.

### 3. Go for it!
When the proposal is accepted, the grant will be paid up-front or on a monthly rate (based on funders/backers liquidity).

**Grant requirement**: 
- keep a Dev Diary about what you're doing
- Define plans on our dashboard and log activities
- Partecipate on monthly assembly

> Why a Dev Diary: this is the simple way to share learning, and for everyone to get excited about what you're doing. We can also reference it later for others interested in funding, to showcase what awesome things we've done. 
Also it encourages transparency among working groups and funders.


### 4. Declare it done (enough)
Keep the spirit of experimentation. If you tried something bold, but didn't get to where you wanted to, **that's fine**. Our priority is "did we learn from it?" and "did it grow the ecosystem?" - you may have made some auxillary wins which are still awesome that we can celebrate. 


## Open Assemblies

We'll discuss the proposals in our open assemblies. You are welcome to make suggestions or express support for a proposal. At some point, During the trimestral assembly we will make a call on which proposals we've agreed on.
If there is a disagreement, we'll just keep talking about it.
